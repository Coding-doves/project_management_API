# Project Management API

## Overview

This is a Project Management API built with FastAPI. It provides features for task assignment, deadlines, progress tracking, and user management. The API supports role-based access control for different user roles: admin, user, and guest.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Create, update, delete, and list tasks.
- **User Management**: Create, update, retrieve, and delete users.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin, user, and guest roles with specific permissions.
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 with JWT tokens for secure access.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

1. **Create Environment Variables**

   Set the following environment variables in your `.env` file or environment:

   ```env
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   ```

2. **Database Configuration**

   - **Endpoint**: `/tasks`
   - **Method**: POST
   - **Headers**: `Authorization: Bearer <your_token>`
   - **Body**:
     ```json
     {

       "deadline": "2024-12-31T23:59:59",
       "progress": 0
     }
     ```

3. **List Tasks**: List all tasks (User or Guest role required).

## Deployment

### Deploying on Render

1. **Create a `render.yaml` File**

   **`render.yaml`**
   ```yaml
   services:
     - type: web
       name: my-fastapi-app
       env: python
       buildCommand: "pip install -r requirements.txt"
       startCommand: "uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 10000"
       plan: free
   ```

2. **Push to Git Repository**

   Ensure your code is pushed to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
